            "\n",
            "Using EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as a financial metric has both pros and cons. While it can be useful in some cases, here are reasons why relying too heavily on EBITDA can be problematic:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Ignores Actual Cash Flow: EBITDA doesn’t account for changes in working capital, capital expenditures, or interest payments. Since it excludes these important cash outflows, it may paint an overly optimistic picture of a company’s cash generation capacity.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Overlooks Debt Obligations: By excluding interest expenses, EBITDA can make highly leveraged companies appear healthier than they actually are. This can mislead investors about the company’s true financial risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Ignores Depreciation and Amortization: While these are non-cash expenses, they reflect the real wear and tear of assets and investments that eventually need to be replaced. Ignoring these can mask the actual costs of maintaining the business.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Can Be Manipulated: EBITDA is easier to manipulate than other metrics like net income. Companies might use it to smooth out earnings, presenting a more favorable financial position.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Not a Standard Measure: EBITDA is not a measure recognized by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This makes it subjective, and companies can calculate it differently, leading to inconsistencies across firms.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Overemphasizes Operating Performance: EBITDA focuses primarily on operating performance, which can be helpful for comparison, but it ignores the full cost structure of the company, especially when non-operational items like taxes and debt are significant.\n",
            "\n",
            " There you have it!\n",
            "\n",
            "While EBITDA can be useful in comparing companies' operating performance without the impact of financial decisions, it doesn’t give a full picture of financial health and can be misleading if used alone.\n",

            "Body: If you look at the story of how the S&P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).\n",
            "\n",
            "Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.\n",

            "ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. \n",

Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.\n",

This move that would represent a sharp about face from its earlier public messaging about the larger company’s prospects.\n",
            "\n",
            "The storied semiconductor firm has made overtures to a number of private equity and strategic investors this week, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak freely about confidential information. Intel has expressed to some of those investors that it would be possible to acquire a majority stake in the Altera business, which was valued at $16.7 billion when Intel acquired it in 2015, said one of the people.\n",

            "CEO Pat Gelsinger and his leadership team have previously said that Intel understands its disadvantaged position and is working aggressively to remedy it. To be sure, the sale of a minority stake in Altera would allow Intel to more easily pursue its semiconductor fabrication ambitions and assuage investors that it has a strong path forward as an independent company.\n",

            "But the sale process also comes as Qualcomm has expressed interest in acquiring its onetime rival, a deal which would face fierce regulatory scrutiny and reshape semiconductor industry.
